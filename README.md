### What I found interesting

- I found this article interesting for several reasons. The **level of detail** about each of the various interview stages provided a valuable insight into the application process at major companies (in this case microsoft), something which I do not have first hand experience with, and the skills/qualities of particular interest to me that needed to be honed in order to succeed as a software engineer. I appreciate the clear structure of the article, as it is divided up by stage of the process, where each section is clearly signposted, going in depth into what each stage involved and the problem outlines for each interview task.
- Additionally, the article highlighted the importance of preparation and the **steps necessary** to go through before a high profile interview has even begin. These long term plans are the kinds of things I take an interest in. I appreciated the highlighting of the solutions that she implemented for each problem. overall, the information presented in the article was interesting to me in regards to highlighting what the focus of my preparation should be in order to secure future internships, especially the detailed study/preparation guide provided at the end showing which topics to focus on.
